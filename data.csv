        "text": "Hi Lufthansa and Miles and More Team We tired to find a solution with your Miles and More Customer Service but we were really very disappointed about their reaction and that they did not offer us any solution at all regarding the following issue: We booked a flight with Aegean Airlines as it is listed as Miles and More Partner first row on your list of partners. We could have booked the same destination with Lufthansa nearly at the same time & price and even from an airport more convenient for us. We though booked the flight with Aegean as a friend of us was flying with it and only because we thought there is no difference in the airline in regard to Miles and More. These flights where the last flights we needed to reach the Frequent Traveller status. We are now very negatively surprized to find out that the Aegean Airlines is NOT a full Miles and More partner and does not count for the Frequent Traveller status! This is not mentioned at all in the list of Miles and More partners!! The man at the customer service hotline even admitted that he knows that the information on the homepage is not complete and that we would have needed to look deeper into the homepage to find somewhere a little footnote informing that some airlines are not counting for the Frequent Traveller status. As we could not believe that a Miles and More employee even admits a fault on the Miles and More homepage and still does not offer a solution we tried to contact the customer service again via eMail to let them double-check the situation. We got an eMail back with the nebulous explanation they cannot do anything for us as they have to treat all their customers in the same way. What do you mean by this? That every person who walks into the trap of unclear and incomplete information on your homepage has to be treated that bad by you? I would really appreciate to see that this disappointing experience with the customer service is not the end of this story and that you talk to us again and at least try to find a solution.",

We could have booked the same destination with Lufthansa nearly at the same time & price and even from an airport more convenient for us. We though booked the flight with Aegean as a friend of us was flying with it and only because we thought there is no difference in the airline in regard to Miles and More. These flights where the last flights we needed to reach the Frequent Traveller status. We are now very negatively surprized to find out that the Aegean Airlines is NOT a full Miles and More partner and does not count for the Frequent Traveller status! This is not mentioned at all in the list of Miles and More partners!! The man at the customer service hotline even admitted that he knows that the information on the homepage is not complete and that we would have needed to look deeper into the homepage to find somewhere a little footnote informing that some airlines are not counting for the Frequent Traveller status. As we could not believe that a Miles and More employee even admits a fault on the Miles and More homepage and still does not offer a solution we tried to contact the customer service again via eMail to let them double-check the situation. We got an eMail back with the nebulous explanation they cannot do anything for us as they have to treat all their customers in the same way. What do you mean by this? That every person who walks into the trap of unclear and incomplete information on your homepage has to be treated that bad by you? I would really appreciate to see that this disappointing experience with the customer service is not the end of this story and that you talk to us again and at least try to find a solution.",

I don't think I should have to wait over 3 hours to be able to rebook a flight even if I am booked in Economy. As it is I am six months pregnant and haven't had a meal since 9 a.m. this morning. Also traveling with my disabled father. So disappointed.",
